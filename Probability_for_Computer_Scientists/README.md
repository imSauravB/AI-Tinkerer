# Problem Statement: Analyze and Optimize Customer Retention for an E-Commerce Platform
## üìù Background:
You are a data analyst for an e-commerce company. The company has noticed fluctuations in customer retention and wants to understand what factors drive long-term loyalty.

You are provided with a dataset containing customer information, order behavior, and feedback.

## üß† Your Tasks
### 1. Descriptive Statistics
Summarize key numerical features: age, purchase frequency, avg. order value, etc.

Compute: mean, median, mode, variance, std deviation, range, percentiles

### 2. Data Visualization
Use histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, KDE plots to visualize:

Spending behavior
Order frequency distribution
Feedback score patterns

### 3. Probability Distributions
Fit and visualize distributions: Normal, Poisson, Binomial

Identify which features follow which distribution

### 4. Outlier Detection
Use Z-score and IQR to detect abnormal customers

Visualize with box plots

### 5. Correlation & Covariance
Compute correlation matrix between:

Order frequency
Order value
Feedback score
Interpret heatmaps

### 6. Hypothesis Testing
Example:

Null Hypothesis (H0): ‚ÄúAverage order value for men = women‚Äù
Use t-test to validate
Use chi-square test for categorical associations (e.g., retention vs feedback score)

### 7. Confidence Intervals
Construct 95% confidence interval for average order value

### 8. Linear Regression (Basic Predictive Modeling)
Predict feedback score based on:

Order frequency
Order value
Delivery time

### 9. Sampling Techniques
Perform random sampling

Compare sample statistics vs population

### 10. Central Limit Theorem
Demonstrate CLT by sampling average order values repeatedly

Plot the distribution of sample means

### üéØ Goal:
Provide insights and statistical evidence on:

1. What factors influence retention?
2. Are there significant differences across genders or age groups?
3. Can we model satisfaction scores?
